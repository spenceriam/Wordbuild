# Wordbuild: MVP (Version 1) Requirements Document

## 1. MVP Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the minimal feature set required for a viable first release of Wordbuild. The MVP focuses on validating the core gameplay mechanics while minimizing development time and complexity.

### 1.2 MVP Goals
- Validate the core gameplay concept
- Gather player feedback on game mechanics
- Establish a foundation for future development
- Create a playable experience with minimal investment

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Players understand the game mechanics without extensive tutorial
- Average session length exceeds 3 minutes
- At least 30% of players attempt a second play session
- Positive qualitative feedback on core gameplay loop

## 2. MVP Feature Set

### 2.1 Core Gameplay (Must Have)
- **Platform with Tractor Beam**: Basic movement and letter capture functionality
- **Falling Letters**: Simple physics for letters dropping from top of screen
- **Word Construction**: Letter placement in predefined slots
- **Basic Scoring**: Points awarded based on completion time
- **Lives System**: Limited attempts (3 lives) per session
- **Level Progression**: Increasing difficulty (word length and letter speed)

### 2.2 Game Content
- **Word Database**: 100-200 common words ranging from 3-6 letters
- **Level Structure**: 20 predefined levels with carefully selected words
- **Game Over State**: Simple screen showing score and restart option

### 2.3 User Interface
- **Main Menu**: Start game and basic instructions
- **Game Screen**: Word frame, platform, score display, and lives indicator
- **Minimal Tutorial**: Brief introduction to controls

3. Word frame appears with empty slots
4. Letters begin falling at a moderate speed
5. Player captures letters using platform and tractor beam
6. When word is completed, player advances to next level
7. Game continues until player loses all lives
8. Game over screen displays score and offers restart

### 3.2 Control Scheme
- **Desktop**: Left/right arrows for movement, spacebar for tractor beam
- **Mobile**: Touch sides of screen for movement, tap platform for tractor beam

### 3.3 Visual Elements
- **Simplified Art Style**: Clean, functional design with minimal animation
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for platform, letters, and word frame
- **Feedback Indicators**: Visual cues for correct/incorrect letter placement

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Development Stack
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js 3.55+
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
